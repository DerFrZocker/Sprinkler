Tool which links PR from Spigot together

# Building

To build this application use:
```shell
mvn clean install
```
The finished build can be found in `main/target/sprinkler-main-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

# Testing

This repository contains some test files and memory implementations of daos for testing.
To probably load the test files, make sure that the application,
which can be found in `main/target/sprinkler-main-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is in the same directory with the `test-data` directory.

**Note**: It should be in the same directory as `test-data`, **not** in the `test-data` directory.
